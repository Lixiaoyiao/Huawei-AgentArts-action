# GitHub requests and recovery

v0.9.2 reuses the Controller client, sticky lifecycle/result comments and
schema-v1 result envelope. Accepted tasks log their operation, trust and run
link. Denied requests cannot post lifecycle comments. Write-task comments stay
deferred until final validation passes or no repository change is confirmed.
The Actions run remains authoritative if terminal comment publication fails.

Only explicitly selected immutable text blobs/trees use a run-scoped cache and
concurrent request merging. The cache retains at most 128 responses and 2 MiB,
is isolated to one client/credential, returns isolated copies, and never
persists across runs. Failed/oversized responses are not cached. Comment scans
reuse their already-read first page. Actor permissions, mutable branches and
entity bindings, immediate write revalidation and unknown-effect reconciliation
always make fresh requests; they never opt into the cache.

Quota-limited GETs may wait and retry at most twice, with at most 15 seconds of
total waiting and enough time left in the current task budget. `retry-after`
and exhausted primary-quota reset headers set the earliest allowed retry time.
An unspecified secondary-limit recovery requires at least a minute, so this
short-budget policy fails immediately. No POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE or ambiguous
transport error is retried by the client. Existing Gateway postcondition reads
remain responsible for uncertain effects. The worker task is never replayed.

`result-json.githubRequests` and the step summary retain redacted counters,
credential scope, `clientRole: main-controller`, safe resource category and recovery time. Lifecycle comments use a separate client and are excluded from these counters. No URLs, request
bodies, response bodies or credential values are included. A quota error has
stable code `GITHUB_QUOTA_EXHAUSTED`; inspect recorded commit/branch/PR and
Gateway receipts before rerunning. A result lists confirmed effects; absence
of an identity does not prove an interrupted external extension had no effect.

Keep three operational scopes distinct:

| Scope              | Credential and evidence                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Production Action  | The configured `github-token`, normally its job's `GITHUB_TOKEN`; result counters refer to this scope only. A supplied PAT/App token can use another budget.                                |
| Core E2E fixtures  | Each fixture job's declared reader/writer Actions token and exact run/attempt identities. The one-blob diagnostic uses a new token context and cannot prove an old fixture token recovered. |
| Release monitoring | The maintainer CLI/OAuth or connector/App installation used to inspect runs and publish. Its quota is not proof of the Action or fixture quota.                                             |

Do not rotate credentials to evade limits. Save the exact SHA, run/artifact
identity, quota headers and recovery time, then resume only the blocked gate
after recovery within an explicit budget. Long waits fail and retain evidence.

This policy follows GitHub's [REST best practices](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/best-practices-for-using-the-rest-api)
and [authentication-specific rate-limit documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api).
Conditional requests are useful for mutable monitoring; production freshness
checks remain uncached, and immutable text reuse needs no monitoring poll.
